###TODO TODO

BUGS 

* When you go faster than your best lap, it shows the delta as -0.000 even though there is a bigger diff



Ease of Experience

* If you do a lap but don't hit the checkpoints, reset the lap so they can go again, don't make them go get that one checkpoint they missed, son.
* Find a way to extend the finish line above and below a bit to avoid 'near misses'


BIG features

* Indicate the check points better!
* Change how the ghost drives & how the replay is recorded, just get the input controls


** BIG BUGS ** 

* The ghost doesn't reload correctly when you start a new level
  
** Juice ** 

* Tweak/refactor the car stretch when turboing
* Add some debris to crashes!

Usability 

* Add keyboard controls to the track menu




Turbo 8 

* The turn at the bottom with the finish line sucks, encourages cutting of the turn
  * Need to be able to place finish lines in other spots wiht a 'direction' encoded in the track maybe
  * So that it doesn't create that weirdness
* Optinoally, shoudl be able to extend teh finish line two pixles above and below..? For near misses
* Also, keep getting a 180 bounce off


* Get the Ready 2 player font for offline use..!
