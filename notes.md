Fix collision angles
 * Collisions are a bit crazy, you shouldn't rebound at nearly 180 degrees from this stuff.
 * Make the rebound angles a bit saner when you hit the wall, less sharp on high angles.

* Tweak out the car stretch when turboing
  * somewhere in drivecar.js 

* If you do a 360 in the air from a turbo jump the actual angle should just point where you point whe you land
  * Currently it does a bit of a catch up
    
  * Best laptime not updating
